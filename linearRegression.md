Abstract
Background: Our primary purpose was to determine the normal range and variability of blood
volume (BV) in healthy children, in order to provide reference values during childhood and
adolescence. Our secondary aim was to correlate these vascular volumes to body size parameters
and pubertal stages, in order to determine the best normalisation parameter.
Methods: Plasma volume (PV) and red cell volume (RCV) were measured and F-cell ratio was
calculated in 77 children with idiopathic nephrotic syndrome in drug-free remission (mean age, 9.
± 4.6 y). BV was calculated as the sum of PV and RCV. Due to the dependence of these values on
age, size and sex, all data were normalised for body size parameters.
Results: BV normalised for lean body mass (LBM) did not differ significantly by sex (p < 0.376) or
pubertal stage (p < 0.180), in contrast to normalisation for the other anthropometric parameters.
There was no significant difference between reference values for children and adults.
Conclusion: LBM was the anthropometric index most closely correlated to vascular fluid
volumes, independent of age, gender and pubertal stage.
Background
Alterations in blood volume (BV) lead to haemodynamic
adaptations in acute and chronic diseases such as insulin-
dependent diabetes mellitus, cardiac, renal and/or hepatic
failure, and nephrotic syndrome [1-4]. To evaluate
changes in BV in children under different clinical condi-
tions, it is necessary to obtain reference values. Despite the
importance in daily clinical practice, only few direct meas-
urements of blood volume have been performed in chil-
dren. In the largest study performed to date in a paediatric
population, 160 infants and children aged 1 hour to 14
years [5], BV was calculated from plasma volume and hae-
matocrit using a fixed F-cell ratio of 0.91, derived from

studies in adults [6]. The F-cell ratio, which determines
the relative distribution of BV between the microvascula-
ture and the large vessels, describes the relation between
whole body and large vessel haematocrit. Due to the Fah-
raeus-Lindqvist effect, however, haematocrit differs signif-
icantly between large vessels and capillaries [7,8]. Use of a
fixed F-cell-ratio of 0.91 not only disregards large inter-
individual variability in adults [7,8], but presumes that
the distribution of large and small vessels in children and
adults is comparable, despite their significantly different
body compositions. To obtain reliable BV measurements,
plasma volume (PV) and red cell volume (RCV) [7,9]

should be measured simultaneously, rather than basing
BV on measurements of PV alone with a fixed F-cell ratio.

The International Committee for Standardisation in
Hematology has recommended measuring RCV by radio-
active chromium or technetium methods, and PV by the
radioiodine labelled albumin method [10]. To date, the
only data available in children were obtained in our cen-
tre, in patients with minimal change nephrotic syndrome
in remission [11]. Although these findings and normali-
zation for LBM were in accordance with findings in adults
[7,9], our earlier study had major limitations. Aside from
the limited number of patients included, the sex ratio of
the prepubertal children was not equally distributed and
the number of patients during pubertal stages 2–4 was too
small to calculate a true reference frame.

The aim of the present study was to obtain a reference
frame for BV in children and adolescents, to calculate the
best parameter for normalisation, and to evaluate the
need for the use of the combined measurement method
(i.e. PV plus RCV). We extended findings in our earlier
cohort of patients [11], particularly by increasing the
number of adolescents in different pubertal stages and the
percentage of females.

Methods
Volume measurements
Twelve hours prior to administration of 131I-human
serum albumin (HSA), KI was administered orally to pre-
vent thyroid uptake of radioactive iodine. On the morn-
ing of the volume determination, 5 ml venous blood was
drawn for red blood cell (RBC) labelling with 51 Cr [10],
and the left and right cephalic veins were catheterised.
After at least 30 min of recumbency, 4 ml blood was
drawn to serve as a blank and for determination of haema-
tocrit. Each subject was administered a bolus injection of
131I-HSA in the laminar stream of 10 ml saline solution

via the rubber extension of a T-extension set (Abbott), a
procedure designed to avoid adhesion of the tracer to the
catheter or connexion set. The syringe was rinsed by flush-
ing twice with saline, and residual radioactivity in all used
material was measured and subtracted from total counts
in the syringe. Exactly 10 minutes later, 4 ml blood was
drawn from the contralateral arm for counting of radioac-
tivity. Subsequently, 51 Cr-RBC was administered by the
same procedure. The radioactive doses (in msv) were cal-
culated as 131I-HSA = 0.0061 × years and 51-Cr-RBC =
0.0073 × years. Haematocrit was determined in triplicate.
Calculations
BV was calculated as RCV + PV [9], whole body haemat-
ocrit was calculated as RCV/BV, and F-cell ratio as whole-
body haematocrit/large vessel haematocrit. Due to differ-
ences in body composition of males and prepubertal [7],
pubertal and older females, BV was analysed separately
for these subgroups and normalised relative to age, sex,
and the most appropriate body size parameters, including
body weight (BW), height (H), body surface area (BSA)
and lean body mass (LBM). BSA was estimated from a
normogram based on height (H) and body weight (BW)
[12]. LBM was estimated from H and BW according to the
formulae:
In males and prepubertal females (Tanner stage 1), LBM
(a) = 0.407BW + 26.7H -19.2,
In post pubertal or older females (Tanner stage 5), LBM
(b) = 0.252BW + 47.3H - 48.3.
In pubertal females (Tanner stages 2–4), LBM(c) = {LBM
(a) + LBM (b)}/
These formulae were derived from the empirical relation
between total body water (TBW), BW and H and between
TBW and LBM (in kg) [7,13]. Elimination of TBW gives
LBM (in kg) as a function of BW (in kg) and H (in m).
LBM can be used as the index for normalisation of body
fluid volumes, independent of gender.
The study was approved by the ethical committee of Uni-
versity Hospital Ghent (1.5.643.98). All patients and/or
their parents gave written informed consent.
Study population
The study cohort consisted of 77 children with steroid
responsive nephrotic syndrome, in whom vascular fluid
volumes were measured during stable remission, and
included the initial cohort of 31 children [11]. All patients
had H, BW and BSA within the normal range (5–95 per-
centile) for their age, were in remission for at least 6
months and free of therapy for at least 3 months. Patients

ics, steroids, cyclosporin A, NSAIDs or antihypertensives.
The baseline demographic and clinical data of the study
group are shown in Table 1.

Statistics
Data are expressed as mean ± standard deviation and
compared using the Mann-Whitney U-test. Pearson's cor-
relation coefficient and linear regression analysis among
age, H, BW, BSA and LBM and the different vascular vol-
ume values (PV, RCV, BV) were used where indicated.

Results
The population consisted of 42 males and 35 females;
their baseline demographic and clinical characteristics are
shown in Table 1. Their mean age was 9.8 ± 4.6 y, mean H

was 133.2 ± 24.8 cm (P65-P25), mean BW was 35.5 ±
17.7 kg (P75-P30), mean BSA was 1.1 ± 0.4 m^2 (P70-P30)
and mean BMI (w/h^2 ) was 18.4 ± 4.2 kg/m^2. Renal func-
tional parameters, including glomerular filtration rate
(GFR), renal plasma flow (RPF) and fractional excretion
of sodium, were within the normal range [14]. All patients
were followed up for at least 6 years after the study, during
which time serum creatinine and blood pressure
remained normal, indicating an absence of severe renal
parenchymal damage. Plasma renin activity and aldoster-
one levels were within normal ranges [14], indicating
none of the patients had experienced major renovascular
disturbances. The values we obtained were somewhat
higher than those reported in the literature, which may
have been due to our samples having been taken at the

arising.

The mean values for PV, RCV and BV (calculated as the
sum of PV and RCV), normalised for age, H, BMI, BW, BSA
and LBM, are shown in Table 2, separated by sex and by
pubertal stage. We observed significant differences
between the sexes for body fluid volumes normalised for
BMI, BW and BSA, but not when we normalised BV for H
and LBM. When we assorted these values by pubertal
stage, we found that only LBM show no statistical differ-
ence for gender (Fig 1a, b, c, d). The correlation coeffi-

cients for BV relative to age, BSA and LBM were of
comparable magnitude and highly significant (p < 0.001),
with the highest r^2 for BV normalised for LBM. The corre-
lation coefficient for BV/LBM was also highly significant
(r= 0.949, p < 0.001) in this paediatric population. The
intercept of the regression line for BV normalised for LBM
was close to 58 ml but did not pass through the origin
(Table 3). Due to the absence of inherent gender-related
differences, we used combined LBM data of males and
females to calculate regression lines. When BSA was used,
the intercepts were clearly different from zero. The regres-
sion line of BV differed significantly between the sexes
(Table 3). The regression of BV on LBM and BSA is shown
in Fig 2 (a,b), which also demonstrates the reference range
of BV as a function of LBM and BSA. When we plotted
individual data for the relationship between BV and LBM,
we found that males and females were evenly distributed
throughout the range of LBM (Fig 2a). The individual data
for the relationship between BV and BSA are plotted in Fig
2b. We found that the F-cell ratio did not differ signifi-
cantly between the sexes, being 0.83 ± 0.09 (n = 47) for
males and 0.85 ± 0.08 (n = 35) for females (Table 2).
When we plotted the regression of BV as a function of
LBM for the entire study population, in which the normal
range was defined as twice the standard deviation and is
identified by the dashed lines, we observed a continuum
from puberty to adulthood (Fig. 3). We observed no sig-
nificant difference between the regression of our data and
those determined earlier in adults [7], when LBM was
used. Because there was a significant difference between
sexes and different pubertal stages when BV was normal-
ized relative to BSA, with a higher BV for males, we
selected LBM as the index for normalisation of body fluid
volumes.
Discussion
To our knowledge, this study is the largest to date on the
direct determination of BV from PV and RCV in children
and adolescents at various pubertal stages. Our pilot study
in 31 patients aged 2–18 years, which measured PV and
RCV, provided reference values for these parameters [11].
The aim of the earlier study was to determine whether
children with idiopathic nephrotic syndrome (INS) expe-
rienced changes in blood volume, or hypovolemia, during
relapses, but we found no evidence that this occurred,
even during paired analysis [14]. We found, however, that
LBM provided the best index for normalisation of body
fluid volumes, resolving the problem of gender differ-
ences and confirming earlier findings in adults [7]. How-
ever, our earlier study had several limitations, including
the small number of patients (n = 31), the predominance
of males, the limited number of adolescents during puber-
tyand not taking into account the pubertal stages. To over-
come these major limitations, we extended our study to a

Although the use of children with idiopathic nephrotic
syndrome in remission as control population may be
problematic when compared with "normal" children,
there are ethical issues concerning studies with radiola-
belled compounds in normal healthy children. This type
of physiological studies is not longer defended, unless the
studied children receive a direct or indirect benefit from

the findings. This is also applicable to the need for a refer-
ence frame to compare values in pathological conditions.
These same ethical considerations are less applicable to
nephrotic children in remission, since studies using radi-
olabelled compounds in these children have led to major
changes in the diagnosis and treatment of hypo-/hypervo-
lemia. Children with minimal change nephrotic syn-

drome in drug free remission are considered to have
normal renal and haemodynamic parameters during pro-
teinuria- and drug-free episodes [14,15]. Glomerular and
tubular function are normal, as are renal histology and
blood pressure, and these factors are not altered during
long term follow up, suggesting that the prognosis of
these patients is very good [14]. All patients in our study
population were in complete remission (no proteinuria)
for at least 6 months, and had received no drug therapy for
at least previous 3 months. In addition, all had normal
renal function, both for glomerular (GFR, RPF, FF) and
tubular parameters (FENa), and their plasma renin activity
and aldosterone levels were within the normal range. In
addition, long term follow up (> 6 y) showed no deterio-
ration of renal function, thereby excluding severe renal
parenchymal damage. This, together with the absence of

clinical evidence for abnormal body composition, allows
us to use this population as a reference for body fluid vol-
umes in children. There is no evident reason why this
highly selected study population cannot be considered as
alternative and at least as the best reference frame availa-
ble.
The aim of this study was to determine a reference frame
for body fluid volumes in children and to find the best
normalisation parameters for BV. In the absence of very
large study groups, normalisation is unavoidable, because
of the large body size and age differences in children. The
use of ratios as a consequence of normalisation, however,
has pitfalls [16]. In order to use a ratio successfully, the
intercept of the line created by plotting one variable
against another must be zero, the relationship must be a
straight line and the variability around the line must be
constant. This methodological problem is clearly demon-
strated by comparing Figures 2A and 3. The best method
for normalisation is the use of standard deviation scores
(SDS) or percentiles, which are interchangeable. Because
of the potential of complex interactions between sex,
pubertal stage, and body composition, this would require
much larger numbers of individuals, of both genders and
at different pubertal states, which is not feasible in young
children. Therefore, normalisation by ratios is the best
available tool, despite its limitations.
We were not surprised to observe a very good linear corre-
lation between the different vascular volumes and the
parameters related to size (age, W, H, BSA, and LBM).
Although correlations with other parameters (BW and
BSA) were apparently limited, the larger intercept, as well
as the sex and pubertal differences, make them unsuitable
as simple normalisation parameters. Our finding of the
highest linear correlation (R = 0.949) with LBM not only
resolves the problem of sex differences, but is also in line
with findings in adults [7]. When plotting individual data,
however, we observed that pubertal children lay above the
mean, but within the positive standard deviation area,
suggesting that, during puberty, BV increases faster than
LBM. Hormonal influences may be responsible for this
phenomenon. In contrast, the absolute values for BV/LBM

in our study population were somewhat lower, but not
significantly different, than the adult values.

Despite statistical evidence in favour of the use of LBM,
some critical comments must be made. Since the formula
for LBM is derived from an empirical relationship, based
on equations from a 20-year-old study, it is not known if
this formula is still appropriate for children of this cen-
tury. The equation is different for males/prepubertal
females and pubertal/older females due to differences in
body composition [7,13,17], but neglects the progressive
changes in body composition during puberty. Because
puberty is a dynamic process and body composition
changes during puberty, the formula for LBM for pubertal
girls should be adapted to pubertal stage. Our previous
study [11] assessed a limited number of adolescents, and
there was an unequal distribution between males and
females, thus obscuring this finding.

Because of these serious methodological considerations
regarding the use of LBM, the other normalisation param-
eters should be evaluated as alternatives, although it is
questionable whether children of all ages can or should be
"forced" to fit a single normalisation. When we normal-
ised for BSA, BW, or H, we observed differences between
males and females during pubertal stages 2–4, as well as
differences with prepubertal and adult values, suggesting
that none of these alternatives can be used as a single nor-
malisation parameter. Rather, we have to take into
account sex and pubertal stage differences, even if we
neglect the theoretical importance of a low intercept
value. This is not surprising inasmuch as the concept of
LBM was created to exclude gender differences in body
composition, and, as a consequence, progressive pubertal
changes. This is not just a mathematical trick, but also an
unavoidable methodological necessity if we want to plot
males and females in one reference frame. The only alter-
native would be to extend the study population to create
reference frames dependent on age, sex and pubertal
stage. The fact that this solution is not achievable due to
many practical and ethical considerations favours the use
of LBM as a single parameter.

Statistical differences in the ratios of volume to various
parameters of body composition may be related to differ-
ences in the derived body composition equations/nomo-
grams rather than to true differences in RCV, PV, or BV.
Significant differences in normalised values are appar-
ently related to differences between the normalisation
parameters during puberty, because BV was the same in
every calculated ratio, and the best correlation was
observed with derived parameters (LBM and BSA) rather
than with measured variables (BW, H or age). This is not
surprising, because direct measured parameters are less
suitable for normalising body composition and for evalu-

ating pathophysiological mechanisms, including the ade-
quacy of peritoneal dialysis, perspiration, and drug
distribution volume.
Conclusion
The aim of the present study was to determine a reference
frame for blood volume studies in children, using a com-
bination of RCV and PV measurements. The wide range of
F-cell ratios clearly shows that the use of plasma volume
and a fixed F-cell ratio of 0.91 is not feasible. Despite its
major theoretical disadvantages, the use of adapted for-
mulas for LBM emerged as the only statistically defensible
normalisation parameter, due to its high correlation fac-
tor and low intercept. LBM also has the advantage of cor-
recting for differences between the sexes and the pubertal
stages, as well as being in accordance with findings in
adults. The adaptation of the LBM equation during
puberty, while artificial, may resolve a methodological
problem. This study offers an important tool for studying
conditions in which alterations in BV may be important,
including hypertension, diabetic nephropathy, capillary
leak syndrome, and nephrotic and nephritic syndromes.
